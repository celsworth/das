/*
 this is going to be to hold what we consider to be an 'Output',
 which is actually a CaeAudioDevice+CaeAudioDataSource combination.
 
 so each row in our priorities table is an Output (rename this class maybe..)
 and if an AudioDevice has more than one DataSource (AirPlay, generally?)
 it may appear more than once with different targets to choose.
